# BachelorArbeit_Template
A repository to show how to implement the Latex-Template of Hochschule Hannover (University of Applied Sciences) for the course of Angewandte Informatik (Applied Computer Science). 

# How to compile
For my bachelors thesis, I decided to spent some money and buy premium access to Overleaf. 

Overleaf is an online Latex Compiler. You can not only write your documents there, but also export them, share them with friends / collaborateurs and, in the premium feature, sync with a Github Repository. I think this will be immensely helpful to track any changes that I made over the course of the thesis. 

Go to: 
overleaf.com and simply import the projet from your Github, after granting Overleaf permission to connect with your Github Profile. 

Of ourse you can use any Latex compiler you like or already have locally installed.
